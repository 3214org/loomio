          A group starts an online discussion about any topic. Clear proposals emerge from the discussion. These proposals are then considered by the whole group, and each member is guided towards making a clear decision. Itâ€™s easy to see how the group feels, and concerns can be discussed and addressed before the best course of action is planned.
        %p
          Group members can be anywhere, and can participate at any time. Every parameter of the discussion/decision-making process can be adapted to fit the particular group and decision faced.
