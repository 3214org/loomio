          A group starts an online discussion about any topic. Clear proposals emerge from the discussion. These proposals are then considered by the whole group, and each member is guided towards making a clear decision. Itâ€™s easy to see how the group feels, and concerns can be discussed and addressed before the best course of action is planned.

          Group members can be anywhere, and can participate at any time. Every parameter of the discussion/decision-making process can be adapted to fit the particular group and decision faced.
